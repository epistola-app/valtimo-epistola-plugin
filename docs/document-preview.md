# Document Preview

The `epistola-document-preview` Formio component shows a live PDF preview of a document that will be generated later in the process. It supports two modes: auto-discover and configured.

> If you want to render or download a PDF that has **already been generated** (driven by process variables on the caller's task), use [`epistola-document`](document-component.md) instead.

**Related documentation:**

- [Document Component](document-component.md) — the after-generation render/download component
- [Data Mapping](data-mapping.md) — how case/process data flows into Epistola templates
- [Use Cases](use-cases.md) — demo scenarios including the bezwaarprocedure

## Modes

### Auto-discover mode

When no process link is configured, the component discovers all `generate-document` process links from running process instances and shows a source dropdown. This is the original behavior — useful when a process is already past the generation point and you want to preview any available document.

### Configured mode

When a process link and override mapping are configured, the component targets a specific `generate-document` activity and feeds form field values into the template as input overrides. This enables previewing a document **while the user is still filling in the form**.

## Configuration

In the Formio builder, click the `epistola-document-preview` component to open its settings. The editForm shows:

### Process Link (required)

A dropdown listing all `generate-document` process links across deployed process definitions. Selecting one stores:

- `processDefinitionKey` — identifies the process (e.g., `objection-handling`)
- `sourceActivityId` — identifies the generate-document service task (e.g., `generate-decision-gegrond`)

### Input Overrides (optional)

A mapping from the live form fields onto the `doc`/`pv` inputs the data mapping will read,
authored as a **JSONata expression over `$form`** (the form's component values). The expression
produces a `{ doc, pv }` overlay that is applied before the generate-document data mapping runs,
so the preview mirrors what generation will produce.

The builder has two modes:

- **Simple** — a `Scope / Input Path / Form Field` table (Scope is `doc` or `pv`; Form Field is a
  dropdown by label). The table serializes to JSONata under the hood.
- **Advanced** — the JSONata editor (with `$form` autocomplete), for transforms the table can't
  express (concatenation, conditionals, functions). A richer expression locks the builder into
  advanced mode.

### Auto-refresh (optional, default on)

Auto-refresh is controllable in **two places**: a builder default (set by the form author) and a
runtime toggle in the preview header (flipped by the end-user filling in the form).

**Builder options** (in the component's edit dialog):

- **Auto-refresh preview as the form is filled in** (checkbox, default **on**) — the default state of
  the runtime toggle. When on, the preview refreshes automatically as the form changes. It does
  **not** refresh on every keystroke: changes are debounced and the preview flushes when a field loses
  focus (blur). It also only re-renders when the mapped data actually changed, so typing in fields the
  mapping doesn't read no longer triggers a refresh.
- **Auto-refresh debounce (ms)** (number, default **1500**) — how long to wait after the last change
  before refreshing. Higher values feel calmer; lower values feel more responsive. Shown only when
  auto-refresh is on. Invalid/negative values fall back to 1500.

**Runtime toggle** — an **Auto-refresh** checkbox in the preview header (shown for override-driven
previews). It starts from the builder default and lets the person filling in the form turn
auto-refresh off/on for their session; the choice is preserved across Formio redraws. Turning it on
refreshes immediately. With it off, the preview updates only via the **Refresh** button.

The **Refresh** button in the preview header always works regardless of these settings, and it
forces a recompute from the live form data — so it loads the preview even before the first edit
(e.g. right after opening a form whose fields are pre-filled).

**Initial load.** When the mapped fields are already filled in on open, the preview loads itself
without a manual edit. Valtimo can populate form data asynchronously after the component mounts
(sometimes without a change event), so the wrapper re-attempts the initial paint a few times over
~2s until the data is present.

#### Example: objection decision preview

The assess-objection form has two fields (`pv:decision`, `pv:motivation`) and a preview component configured as:

```json
{
  "type": "epistola-document-preview",
  "key": "preview",
  "label": "Voorbeeld Besluitbrief",
  "processDefinitionKey": "objection-handling",
  "sourceActivityId": "generate-decision-gegrond",
  "overrideMapping": "{ \"pv\": { \"motivation\": $form.`pv:motivation`, \"decision\": $form.`pv:decision` } }"
}
```

Form field keys that aren't bare identifiers (e.g. `pv:motivation`) are backtick-quoted so JSONata
reads them as a single property. When the user edits the Motivatie field, the preview regenerates once
the field loses focus (or after the debounce, default ~1.5s) — and only if the mapped value changed.
Auto-refresh can be turned off so the preview only updates on the **Refresh** button.

Dotted Formio keys are treated as path traversal, matching Formio's own submission-data shape. If a
field key combines a value-resolver prefix with a nested path, only the unsafe segment is quoted.
For `doc:adres.straat`, use:

```jsonata
$form.`doc:adres`.straat
```

Do not quote the whole dotted key as one segment.

> **Legacy format.** Forms authored before this change store `overrideMapping` as an object of
> `"form:<componentKey>"` references (e.g. `{ "pv": { "motivation": "form:pv:motivation" } }`). These
> keep working — the frontend converts them to JSONata on the fly — and persist in the new format the
> next time the form is saved in the builder. The admin page's **Forms** tab lists forms still on the
> legacy format (`GET /admin/forms/legacy-override`).

## How it works

### Override mapping format

The mapping is a JSONata expression evaluated against a single binding, `$form` (the form's
component values), that returns a `{ doc, pv }` object. A `$form.<key>` reference resolves to the
live value of that form component (and is omitted from the overlay when the field is empty/unset).

### Runtime flow

```
Form field changes
  ↓
Formio wrapper (when auto-refresh is on):
  - root.on('change')  — debounced (default 1500ms, configurable)
  - root.element focusout (blur) — flushes immediately
  (when auto-refresh is off, only the initial paint + the Refresh button trigger it)
  ↓
computeInputOverrides(overrideMapping, formData)  [async]
  - evaluates the JSONata expression with $form = formData
    (legacy form:-ref objects are converted to JSONata first)
  - keeps only doc/pv scopes that resolved at least one field
  ↓
Dedup: skip if the computed overrides equal the last pushed value
  ↓
Pushes overrides to the Angular component's dedicated `inputOverrides` input
  (NOT Formio's value — Valtimo's bridge would let Formio reset that to its
   emptyValue on the next redraw, cancelling the preview)
  ↓
POST /api/v1/plugin/epistola/preview
  {
    documentId, processDefinitionKey, sourceActivityId,
    inputOverrides: { doc: {...}, pv: {...} }
  }
  ↓
Backend: PreviewService.generatePreview()
  - resolves process link → gets catalogId, templateId, dataMapping
  - creates OverlayMap(inputOverrides.doc, lazyDocumentContent) for $doc
  - creates process-variable context that checks inputOverrides.pv first
  - evaluates JSONata mapping with overridden inputs
  - calls Epistola preview API → returns PDF
  ↓
PDF rendered in <object> tag
```

### OverlayMap — layered resolution

The `OverlayMap` checks overrides first and only delegates to the base map for non-overridden paths:

```
$doc.motivation  →  found in override  →  return override value
$doc.objector    →  not in override    →  fall through to LazyDocumentMap → load from DB
```

For nested access, when both overlay and base have a Map for the same key, a recursive `OverlayMap` is returned. This means the document is only loaded from the database when a non-overridden path is actually accessed.

### Design-time view

In the Formio builder (no runtime context), the component shows a configuration summary instead of an empty preview panel:

- Process definition key and activity ID
- The override mapping JSONata expression (legacy objects shown as their converted JSONata)
